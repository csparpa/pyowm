##  What is it?
PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.

It allows quick and easy consumption of OWM weather data from Python applications via a simple object model and in a human-friendly fashion.

PyOWM runs on Python 2.7 and Python 3.2+, and integrates with [Django 1.10+ models](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm/wiki/Django-support).


##  Installation

Install with `pip` for your ease:

```shell
$ pip install pyowm
```

There is a lot of alternatives: [setuptools](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm/wiki/Install#install-from-source-with-setuptools), [Windows installers](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm/wiki/Install#windows-exe) and common package managers such as [Yaourt](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm/wiki/Install#on-archlinux-with-yaourt)

Eager to fetch the very latest updates to PyOWM? Install the development trunk:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm.git@develop
```



##  Usage

### API key

As the OpenWeatherMap API needs a valid API key to allow responses,
*PyOWM won't work if you don't provide one*. This stands for both the free and paid (pro) subscription plans.

You can signup for a free API key [on the OWM website](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)

Please notice that the free API subscription plan is subject to requests throttling.

### Examples

That's what you can do with PyOWM and a free OWM API Key:

```python
import pyowm

owm = pyowm.OWM('your-API-key')  # You MUST provide a valid API key

# Have a pro subscription? Then use:
# owm = pyowm.OWM(API_key='your-API-key', subscription_type='pro')

# Search for current weather in London (UK)
observation = owm.weather_at_place('London,uk')
w = observation.get_weather()
print(w)                      # <Weather - reference time=2013-12-18 09:20,
                              # status=Clouds>

# Weather details
w.get_wind()                  # {'speed': 4.6, 'deg': 330}
w.get_humidity()              # 87
w.get_temperature('celsius')  # {'temp_max': 10.5, 'temp': 9.7, 'temp_min': 9.0}

# Search current weather observations in the surroundings of
# lat=22.57W, lon=43.12S (Rio de Janeiro, BR)
observation_list = owm.weather_around_coords(-22.57, -43.12)
```

And this is a usage example with a paid OWM API key:

```python
import pyowm

paid_owm = pyowm.OWM(API_key='your-pro-API-key', subscription_type='pro')

# Will it be sunny tomorrow at this time in Milan (Italy) ?
forecast = paid_owm.daily_forecast("Milan,IT")
tomorrow = pyowm.timeutils.tomorrow()
forecast.will_be_sunny_at(tomorrow)  # Always True in Italy, right? ;-)
```

More PyOWM usage examples are available [here](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm/blob/master/pyowm/docs/usage-examples.md).


## Alpine docker support

Build a single image with its specific Dockerfile:
```shell
docker build  . -f Dockerfile.alpine-py2small -t csparpa/pyowm.alpine-py2small
```

Or build all dockerfiles:

```shell
cd scripts && ./generate_alpine_docker_images.sh
```

Use the sample getTemp.py script to test it:

```shell
# docker run csparpa/pyowm.alpine-py2small getTemp.py -k your_api_key -p "Omsk"
Using key your_api_key to query temperature in "Omsk"...
Coordinates of Omsk: lon=73.4 lat=55.0
Temperature at 2017-12-11 20:00:00: -12.0C
```
